## Corentin Wallez, Google

CIS 565 Guest Lecture

Monday, November 7

**Abstract**

Explicit graphics APIs such as Vulkan and D3D12 are a significant departure from the graphics APIs used
in the last 10 years (that includes WebGL). In the name of performance and control, they introduce many
new concepts that can sometimes be difficult to grasp. This talk will present the shortcomings of older
APIs when used with new GPU architectures and how they are solved by new concepts present in the explicit APIs.
In particuler we'll look in details at pipeline states, command buffer and queues, the binding model, and render passes.
